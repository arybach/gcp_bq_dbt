  - name: gen_hex_key
    description: >
      dbt_utils(1.0.0 version).generate_surrogate_key() resolves into incorrect compiled sql syntax:
      to_hex(md5(cast(coalesce(cast( as STRING), '_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_') || '-' || coalesce(cast( as STRING), '_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_') as STRING)))  as  tripid,
      so created a simple replacement
